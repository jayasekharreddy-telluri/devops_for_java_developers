🔥 AWS RDS – 4 Years Experience Interview Notes
1️⃣ What is Amazon RDS?

Amazon RDS is a fully managed relational database service that handles:

Provisioning

Patching

Backups

Replication

Failover

Supports:

MySQL

PostgreSQL

MariaDB

Oracle

SQL Server

Aurora

👉 Interview line:

“RDS allows teams to focus on application logic instead of database maintenance.”

2️⃣ Single-AZ vs Multi-AZ (VERY IMPORTANT)
Single-AZ

One DB instance

No standby

Used for dev/test

Lower cost

Multi-AZ

Primary + Standby in different AZs

Synchronous replication

Automatic failover (30–60 seconds)

Same endpoint after failover

👉 Interview line:

“Multi-AZ improves availability, not performance.”

3️⃣ Read Replicas (Scaling Concept)

Used for read scalability

Asynchronous replication

Separate endpoint

Can be promoted to standalone DB

Use cases:

Read-heavy applications

Reporting

Analytics

👉 Interview line:

“Read replicas help scale read traffic, while Multi-AZ ensures availability.”

4️⃣ Backup & Recovery Strategy
Automated Backups

Enabled by default

Daily snapshot + transaction logs

Point-in-time recovery

Retention: 1–35 days

Manual Snapshots

User triggered

Retained until deleted

Used before major changes

👉 Interview line:

“Automated backups allow PITR, while manual snapshots are used for long-term retention.”

5️⃣ Security (Must Sound Senior)
Network Security

Runs inside VPC

Controlled via Security Groups

Prefer private subnet for production

Authentication

DB password

IAM database authentication

Secrets Manager integration

Encryption

At rest using AWS KMS

In transit using SSL/TLS

👉 Interview line:

“We avoid hardcoded credentials and use Secrets Manager with encrypted connections.”

6️⃣ RDS Proxy (Advanced Topic)
Why RDS Proxy?

Manages DB connections

Prevents connection storms

Improves failover handling

Ideal for microservices & Lambda

👉 Interview line:

“RDS Proxy improves scalability by pooling connections and reducing DB load.”

7️⃣ Performance & Scaling
Vertical Scaling

Change instance type (t → m → r)

Causes brief downtime

Storage Scaling

Auto storage scaling supported

IOPS depends on storage type

Monitoring

CloudWatch metrics

Performance Insights

Slow query logs

8️⃣ Environment Strategy (4-Year Expectation)
Environment	Setup
Dev	Single-AZ, small instance
QA	Single/Multi-AZ
Prod	Multi-AZ + backups + monitoring

Spring Boot:

--spring.profiles.active=dev / rds / prod

🎯 REAL INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
Q1️⃣ Difference between Multi-AZ and Read Replica?

Answer:

Multi-AZ → High availability (sync)

Read Replica → Read scaling (async)

Q2️⃣ What happens during Multi-AZ failover?

Answer:

Standby promoted to primary

DNS endpoint updated

Application reconnects automatically

Q3️⃣ How do you secure RDS in production?

Answer:

Private subnet

Security groups

IAM auth / Secrets Manager

Encryption at rest & in transit

Q4️⃣ How do you handle database connections in microservices?

Answer:

Use HikariCP

Use RDS Proxy

Limit max connections

Q5️⃣ Can RDS scale automatically?

Answer:

Storage can auto-scale

Instance scaling is manual

Read replicas can be added dynamically

Q6️⃣ How do you monitor slow queries?

Answer:

Enable slow query logs

Use Performance Insights

Analyze CloudWatch metrics

🏗 RDS ARCHITECTURE SCENARIOS
Scenario 1: Microservices with High Traffic

Design:

RDS PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ)

RDS Proxy

Read Replicas

Private subnet

Why?

HA + scaling

Connection pooling

Secure network

Scenario 2: Cost-Optimized Dev Environment

Design:

Single-AZ

db.t4g.micro

Public access (restricted SG)

Scenario 3: Disaster Recovery Strategy

Design:

Automated backups

Cross-region snapshots

Manual snapshot before releases

Scenario 4: Spring Boot + RDS

Flow:

Spring Boot app

HikariCP pool

RDS endpoint

Failover handled automatically

🧠 FINAL INTERVIEW VERDICT
